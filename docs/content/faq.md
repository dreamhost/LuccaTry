Questions from the Caterpillar: WonderBear FAQ

## Introduction
"Who are YOU?" asked the Caterpillar. We're much friendlier than that, and happy to answer all your questions about WonderBear. Here's everything you need to know about your journey down the rabbit hole.

## Product Questions

### Question 1
**Q: What age group is WonderBear suitable for?**

**A:** WonderBear is designed for children ages 3 and up due to small detachable accessories. However, WonderBear is equally beloved by adult collectors and literary enthusiasts! For younger children, we recommend parental supervision with the removable accessories.

### Question 2
**Q: How big is WonderBear?**

**A:** WonderBear stands 16 inches (40 cm) tall when seated, making it the perfect size for hugs while still displaying impressive details. The top hat adds an additional 2 inches of height when worn.

### Question 3
**Q: Are the accessories removable?**

**A:** Yes! Part of WonderBear's charm is its interactive nature. The top hat, waistcoat, and miniature pocket watch charm are all removable and reattachable. The playing card symbols on the paws and the facial features are permanently embroidered.

### Question 4
**Q: Is WonderBear machine washable?**

**A:** We recommend spot cleaning WonderBear with mild soap and water. For deeper cleaning, the removable accessories can be hand washed separately, and the bear itself can be surface cleaned. To preserve the special details and shape, machine washing is not recommended.

## Materials & Safety

### Question 5
**Q: What materials is WonderBear made from?**

**A:** WonderBear is crafted from premium polyester plush fabric with a velvety soft texture. The filling is high-quality polyester fiberfill, and details like the waistcoat are made from cotton fabric. All materials meet or exceed international safety standards for children's toys.

### Question 6
**Q: Is WonderBear safe for children with allergies?**

**A:** WonderBear is made from hypoallergenic materials and is suitable for most children. However, as with any plush toy, if your child has specific allergies, please review the detailed materials list on the product packaging or contact our customer service team.

### Question 7
**Q: How durable is WonderBear?**

**A:** Very! We've designed WonderBear to withstand years of loving. The reinforced stitching, quality materials, and careful construction ensure that WonderBear can be both a well-loved playtime companion and a lasting keepsake.

## Ordering & Shipping

### Question 8
**Q: Is WonderBear a limited edition item?**

**A:** Yes, each WonderBear is part of a limited production run. Each bear comes with a numbered certificate of authenticity, making it a true collector's item.

### Question 9
**Q: How long does shipping take?**

**A:** Standard shipping within the United States takes 3-5 business days. International shipping typically takes 7-14 business days, depending on the destination. Expedited shipping options are available at checkout.

### Question 10
**Q: Do you ship internationally?**

**A:** Yes! WonderBear can journey to Wonderlands all over the globe. International shipping is available to most countries. Specific shipping rates and delivery times will be calculated at checkout based on your location.

## Care Instructions

### Question 11
**Q: How should I display or store my WonderBear?**

**A:** For display, WonderBear looks charming on a shelf or bed, ideally away from direct sunlight which can fade the colors over time. If storing WonderBear, we recommend a cool, dry place in the original box if possible. Avoid vacuum-sealed storage which can permanently compress the plush filling.

### Question 12
**Q: What if a piece gets lost?**

**A:** We understand that even in the best Wonderlands, things occasionally go missing! Replacement accessories (top hat, waistcoat, watch charm, and mini storybook) are available for purchase separately through our customer service department.

### Question 13
**Q: Can I purchase additional outfits for my WonderBear?**

**A:** Not yet, but stay tuned! We're currently developing additional Wonderland-themed costume sets for WonderBear that will be available in the coming months. Join our mailing list to be the first to know when these become available.

## Return Policy

### Question 14
**Q: What is your return policy?**

**A:** If you're not completely delighted with your WonderBear, you may return it in its original condition and packaging within 30 days for a full refund. Please note that due to the collectible nature of WonderBear, we cannot accept returns of items that show signs of use or have missing pieces.

### Question 15
**Q: Does WonderBear come with a warranty?**

**A:** Yes! Each WonderBear comes with a one-year warranty against manufacturing defects. This doesn't cover normal wear and tear or damage from improper use, but we stand behind our craftsmanship and materials.
