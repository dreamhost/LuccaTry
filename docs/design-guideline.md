  - Playing card (collection information)
  - Key (account/login)
  - Rabbit (quick navigation/shortcuts)

### Illustrations & Graphics

- Use custom illustrations that blend classic teddy bear aesthetics with Wonderland elements
- Illustrations should have a hand-drawn quality with attention to detail
- Incorporate Alice in Wonderland motifs subtly throughout (playing cards, chess pieces, teacups)
- Use illustrations to enhance storytelling rather than merely decorating
- Maintain a consistent illustration style throughout the website

### Patterns & Textures

- Subtle playing card suit patterns (hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades) can be used for backgrounds
- Checkerboard patterns can reference the chess theme in Through the Looking Glass
- Fabric textures may be used to emphasize the tactile nature of the teddy bear
- Use textures sparingly to avoid visual clutter

## Image Guidelines

### Product Photography

- High-quality, well-lit images of the WonderBear from multiple angles
- Close-up shots highlighting specific Wonderland-themed details
- Context shots showing the bear in whimsical settings
- Scale reference images to show size
- Consistent style across all product images
- Clean backgrounds for product-focused shots

### Lifestyle Photography

- Warm, bright imagery showing the WonderBear in use
- Settings that suggest wonder and imagination
- Images should evoke the feeling of stepping into a storybook
- Include diverse representations of children and adults enjoying the product
- Maintain a dreamy, slightly vintage quality to photography

### Image Treatment

- Consistent color grading that enhances the color palette
- Subtle vignetting to create a storybook feel
- Avoid overly saturated or heavily filtered images

## Layout Principles

### Grid System

- 12-column grid for desktop layouts
- Consistent gutters (24px standard)
- Section padding: 80px top/bottom on desktop, 40px on mobile
- Content container max-width: 1200px

### Visual Hierarchy

- Use size, color, and spacing to create clear hierarchy
- Most important elements (CTA, product images) should have visual prominence
- Guide the user's eye through the page in an intentional sequence
- Use whitespace strategically to create focus and separation

### Spacing System

- Base unit: 8px
- Apply spacing in multiples of the base unit (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.)
- Maintain consistent spacing between similar elements
- Increase spacing between distinct sections
- Reduce spacing proportionally on mobile devices

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints

- Mobile: 320px - 767px
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px
- Desktop: 1024px+

### Mobile Considerations

- Simplified navigation (hamburger menu)
- Stacked layout with key information prioritized
- Larger touch targets (minimum 44px Ã— 44px)
- Reduced padding and margins
- Font sizes reduced appropriately
- Critical CTAs remain prominent

### Content Prioritization

- Hero image and primary CTA remain prominent across all devices
- On mobile, prioritize product images and key selling points
- Less critical content (detailed story, some testimonials) can be condensed on smaller screens

## Animation & Interaction

### Micro-interactions

- Subtle animations for button hovers and clicks
- Form field focus states
- Navigation highlights
- Smooth scroll for anchor links

### Page Transitions

- Subtle fade-in effects for page elements as they enter viewport
- Staggered animations for related elements
- Maximum animation duration: 0.5 seconds
- All animations should have easing functions for natural movement

### Wonderland-Themed Interactions

- Playing card flip effects for testimonials
- Clock-inspired loading indicators
- "Down the rabbit hole" scroll animations
- Subtle "growing/shrinking" effects (referencing Alice's size changes)

## Accessibility Guidelines

- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA compliance standards
- Ensure color contrast ratios meet accessibility standards
- Provide text alternatives for all images
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include proper ARIA labels where necessary
- Ensure the site is fully functional with screen readers
- Avoid conveying information through color alone
- Provide visible focus states for all interactive elements

## Implementation Notes

- Prioritize page loading performance
- Optimize all images and assets
- Consider progressive loading for image-heavy sections
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility
- Test thoroughly on various devices and screen sizes
- Maintain code quality and documentation
