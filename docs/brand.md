# Brand Guidelines: WonderBear

## Brand Identity

### Brand Name
**WonderBear**: The name combines the whimsical world of "Wonder" from Alice in Wonderland with the classic comfort of a "Bear," creating an immediate association with both the literary theme and the product itself.

### Tagline
**"Curiosity Led to Cuddles"**: This tagline references Alice's curiosity that led her down the rabbit hole, while connecting it to the tactile comfort of a teddy bear.

### Logo Treatment
The WonderBear logo combines a classic teddy bear silhouette wearing a top hat with subtle Alice in Wonderland motifs. The wordmark uses a combination of whimsical and classic typography, with "Wonder" in a fanciful script and "Bear" in a more grounded serif font.

## Brand Story & Positioning

### Brand Story
WonderBear was born from a love of classic literature and the timeless comfort of teddy bears. Our founders, avid collectors and parents themselves, noticed that while many character plush toys existed, few captured the magic of literary classics in a way that honored the original work while creating something children would love to cuddle.

Inspired by Lewis Carroll's tales of wonder and curiosity, WonderBear invites children and adults alike to journey into a world where imagination meets comfort. Each bear is crafted with attention to the delightful details of Wonderland while maintaining the huggable quality essential to a beloved teddy bear.

### Brand Positioning
WonderBear positions itself as a premium, collectible teddy bear that bridges the gap between literary appreciation and childhood comfort. Unlike mass-produced character toys or generic teddy bears, WonderBear offers a unique product that:

- Celebrates classic literature in a tangible, huggable form
- Appeals to both children and adult collectors
- Features handcrafted details inspired by authentic elements from the original stories
- Serves as both a plaything and a keepsake
